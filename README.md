# Chess Game with Minimax Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains a chess game implementation that utilizes the Minimax algorithm for decision-making. The Minimax algorithm is a powerful technique in adversarial search, commonly used in games like chess to determine the best possible move.

## Features

- **Chess Game Implementation**: A fully functional chess game with all standard rules and mechanics.
- **Minimax Algorithm Integration**: The game AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm, enabling it to make strategic decisions based on opponent moves.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: To enhance the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm, Alpha-Beta pruning is implemented to reduce the search space.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Game**: Open the repository in your preferred Python environment and run the main script.
3. **Start Playing**: Play against the AI, which will make moves based on the Minimax algorithm.

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to determine the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. It evaluates possible moves by recursively exploring the game tree up to a certain depth, assigning a value to each move based on the resulting game state.
